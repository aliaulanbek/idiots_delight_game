You start by shuffling the deck and dealing out 4 cards. Examine the last 4 cards (in this case there are only 4 cards). If the outer pair (the first and fourth cards) are the same rank, discard all 4 cards. Otherwise, if the middle pair (second and third cards) are the same suit, then discard them.  As long as you have at least 4 cards in your hand, you will attempt to discard.  If you cannot discard, draw a card and compare the last 4 cards as before.  If you have less than 4 cards in your hand, draw until you have 4 cards.  Continue until the deck is empty.  

The program automatically runs the game and tells you if you won at the end. You can look through each round to view how the card were/weren't discarded. The likelyhood of winning the game are very slim, however, there are winning seeds you can enable to view a winning game.
